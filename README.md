# CCIP Subgraphs

### The following folders contains subgraphs for all of the CCIP router contracts deployed on their major chains.

Due to the architecture of CCIP, the data that is emitted by the `Router` contract is hashed with Keccak.
This means that if the `Receiver` contract does not emit the raw data, the only way to see that data is to look at the CCIP (oracle) explorer.
